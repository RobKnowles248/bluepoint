<h1 align="center">Bluepoint</h1>

[View the live project here.]()

Bluepoint is a site similar to climbing websites [8a.nu](https://www.8a.nu/) and [UKClimbing](https://www.ukclimbing.com/) where users create a logbook of outdoor climbs that they have completed. However, instead of logging successful climbs, users will log their successful belays of other climber's ascents. The term "bluepoint" is given to this by some climbers.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### User stories

    -   #### Viewing and Navigation

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site so that I can decide if the site is for me.
        2. As a site user, I want to be able to navigate easily to pages of the site, so that I can enjoy using the site.

    -   #### Registration and User Accounts

        1. As a Site User, I want to be able to easily register for an account, so I can view my profile and log bluepoints.
        2. As a Site User, I want to be able to easily login or logout, so I can access my profile and log bluepoints quickly.
        3. As a Site User, I want to be able to easily recover my password if I forget it, so I am never locked out of my account.

        5. As a Site user, I want to have a logbook page, so that I can view and edit my existing bluepoints and personal details.

        2. As a logged in user, I want to be able to see other users logbooks, so that I can compare with mine.
        3. As a logged in user, I want to be able to add other users as friends, so that I can keep up to date with my friends' blupeoints.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are blue and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Montserrat font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly. Montserrat is a clean font used frequently in programming, so it is both attractive and appropriate.
    -   #### Imagery
        -   Imagery is important. The large, background hero image is designed to be striking and catch the user's attention. It also has a modern, energetic aesthetic.
