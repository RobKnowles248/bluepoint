<h1 align="center">Bluepoint</h1>

[View the live project here.](https://bluepoint-rob.herokuapp.com/)

Bluepoint is a site similar to climbing websites [8a.nu](https://www.8a.nu/) and [UKClimbing](https://www.ukclimbing.com/) where users create a logbook of outdoor climbs that they have completed. However, instead of logging successful climbs, users will log their successful belays of other climber's ascents. The term "bluepoint" is given to this by some climbers.

## User Experience (UX)

-   ### Primary Goals

    To create a site similar to the inspirations for this where climbers can keep a logbook of climbs that they have belayed other people on rather than climbs they have done themselves.

-   ### Developer Goals

    -   To gain experience using the Django framework to build a full stack application.
    -   To create a site where friends of the developer and other climbers can log their "bluepoints".

-   ### User stories

    -   #### Viewing and Navigation

        1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site so that I can decide if the site is for me.
        2. As a site user, I want to be able to navigate easily to pages of the site, so that I can enjoy using the site.

    -   #### Registration and User Accounts

        1. As a Site User, I want to be able to easily register for an account, so I can view my profile and log bluepoints.
        2. As a Site User, I want to be able to easily login or logout, so I can access my profile and log bluepoints quickly.
        3. As a Site User, I want to be able to easily recover my password if I forget it, so I am never locked out of my account.
        4. As a Site User, I want to receive a confirmation email after registering, so that I can verify my registration was successful.
        5. As a Site user, I want to have a logbook page, so that I can view and edit my existing bluepoints and personal details.

    -   #### Logging Bluepoints
        1. As a logged in user, I want to be able to log my bluepoints, so that I can add to my logbook of bluepoints.
        2. As a logged in user, I want to be able to see other users logbooks, so that I can compare with mine.
        3. As a logged in user, I want to be able to search for other users to compare their logbooks to mine.

    -   #### Donations
        1. As a donor, I want to be able to easily enter my payment information, so that I can donate quickly and easily.
        2. As a donor, I want to know that my payment details are secure, so that I can pay confidently.
        3. As a donor, I want to see confirmation after I have donated, to know my donation was successful.

-   ### Design
    -   #### Colour Scheme
        -   The two main colours used are blue and white.
    -   #### Typography
        -   The Roboto font is the main font used throughout the whole website with Sans Serif as the fallback font in case for any reason the font isn't being imported into the site correctly.
        -   The heading use the Nunito font

## Data Schema

A number of new Django models were created to contain the data required for the site which are detailed below

-   ### Donation model

    The Donation model was a model for donation objects created when users of the site donated to the site. The fields in the model are:

    -   donation_number (CharField): The unique id for the donation generated by uuid.
    -   full_name (CharField): The full name of the user making the donation.
    -   email (CharField): The email address of the user making the donation.
    -   date (DateTimeField): The date when the donation was created.
    -   donation_amount (DecimalField): The amount of money donated.
    -   paid (BooleanField): Whether or not the donation has been successfully processed.

-   ### Logbook model

    The Logbook model was a model tied to the User model used as a model for each logbook on the site. The fields in the model are:

    -   user (OneToOneField): A OneToOneField to the User model.
    -   max_bluepoint (CharField): The highest grade of bluepoint in the logbook.

-   ### Bluepoint model

    A model for each bluepoint logged for a user. The fields in the model are:

    -   route_name (CharField): The name of the route that the user belayed a climber on.
    -   grade (CharField): The grade of the route the user belayed a climber on. This uses the [French sport climbing grades](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grade_(climbing)#French_numerical_grades) which are the most commonly used sport climbing grades in Europe.
    -   sort_grade (IntegerField): A field used to sort the bluepoint by grade.
    -   user (ForeignKey): Assigns the bluepoint to the correct logbook.
    -   comment (TextField): An optional comment the user can make about their bluepoint.
    -   date_added (DateTimeField): The date when the log was added used for sorting the latest bluepoints
    -   climber (CharField): The climber belayed by the user during their bluepoint.

## Deployment

The site was deployed using the following steps:

1. Created a new app on Heroku called 'bluepoint-rob' in the European region.

2. Provisioned a new Postgres database in the resources tab on the Heroku dashboard.

3. Used pip to install dj_database_url and psycopg2-binary to the development environment

4. Imported dj_database_url in settings.py and replaced the default database with a call to `dj_database_url.parse(url)` with the database url being the one for our new Postgres database in our config vars in Heroku.

5. Ran the migrations on the new database and created a superuser.

6. Added an if statement to settings.py to decide which database to connect to depending on the environment variables.

7. Installed gunicorn using pip as our webserver.

8. Created a Procfile to tell Heroku to create a web dyno which will run gunicorn

9. Logged in to the Heroku CLI and ran `heroku config:set DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC=1 --app <app_name>` to stop Heroku trying to collect the static files when we deploy.

10. Added the Heroku app hostname to allowed hosts in settings.py.

11. Ran `heroku git:remote -a bluepoint-rob` to set up the git remote.

12. Commit and pushed any changes then ran `git push heroku master`

13. In the deploy tab in the Heroku dashboard, connected the app to our github repository and enabled automatic deploys.

14. An AWS S3 bucket was created and setup to store the static files of the app.
